 * Non-code-related change requested by debian package maintainer.
   Other distributions are unaffected by it.


v1.1.1                                                      (2017-12-04)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * BUGFIX: Reading metadata file with extended attributes entries led
           to corruption of metadata represented in memory on 64-bit
           platforms, so applying could led to corruption of metadata
           on disk too.  Bug discovered thanks to Uros Juvan.


v1.1.0                                                      (2016-02-01)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * BUGFIX: Applying metadata with extended attribute having null byte
           in value zeroed all following bytes of this xattr value.

 * BUGFIX: Reading extended attributes while not having permissions
           resulted in crash.

 * Empty directories not present in metadata can be now removed when
   applying stored metadata if -E / --remove-empty-dirs option is used.

 * Stored metadata (in .metadata file by default) and real metadata
   (from filesystem) can be now dumped in human-readable form using new
   action: -d / --dump.  Please do not rely on its current format!

 * Scripts in example/ directory do not require bash anymore and there
   is a new example for post checkout hook.

 * Dependency on libattr's xattr.h header has been removed.
   As long as your libc provides sys/xattr.h (glibc does it since v2.3),
   everything should be fine.

 * Dependency on libbsd has been added.  It's used by dump action.
